description: Audit and fix website access and rendering for search crawlers. Use for robots.txt, sitemap indexes, raw versus rendered HTML, load-speed evidence, and the technical checklist in the AICW book.
license: MIT
compatibility: Use available file, web, or CMS connector access for the selected website. Bundled scripts require command access and Node.js 22+. Browser checks need a browser runtime. Connectors are not included.

# Audit technical access

Book basis: Eugene Mironichev’s [AI Search Engine Optimization Guide](https://aichatwatch.com/books/ai-seo-guide/). Read [book scope and attribution](references/book.md) before applying recommendations. Use only its optimization principles; label engineering details and current corrections separately. Include the book credit and relevant PDF pages in the final deliverable. When asked about the source or to show the book, provide its title, author, and this clickable link; provide the full PDF link from that reference when requested.

Select the website before site-specific work. Questions about the book or the skill itself need no website target. Use the user’s URL, project, or connected site when the target is clear. Otherwise ask: “Which website should I work on: a URL, local project, or connected CMS?” Follow [target and access selection](references/workflow.md#select-the-website-and-access). A URL permits inspection; edits need access to the selected source or CMS. Ask only for missing information, not for details already supplied.

Runtime: Node.js 22+ for bundled checks. Optional puppeteer-core and installed Chrome for browser checks.

Resolve `references/` and `scripts/` from this installed skill folder, not from the website folder. Run the helper by its absolute path. For file audits, pass the selected website with `--root`; keep paths with spaces quoted. Check `node --version` before running it. If command access or Node.js 22+ is unavailable, review available page content or connector data and mark executable checks unverified.

Read [technical checks](references/technical.md), [workflow](references/workflow.md), and the relevant [platform](references/platforms.md). Use [tools](references/tools.md) to run `scripts/audit.mjs` against HTML files, a preview, or the selected public URL with `--online`. Connector records alone do not show HTTP behavior.

First establish the intended audience and crawler policy. Training, search indexing, and user-triggered retrieval serve different purposes. Keep intentional exclusions, staging restrictions, authentication, and private pages intact.

Inspect the report's coverage before interpreting its findings. Files cannot establish HTTP behavior. Local HTTP cannot establish production CDN or firewall behavior. A browser comparison cannot reproduce every crawler. Missing evidence is unknown or skipped, not a pass.

For a requested fix, edit the source responsible for the defect: the HTML, framework component, CMS configuration, sitemap generator, or server configuration that the available tools expose. Use the existing build, preview, or CMS workflow and inspect the saved result. Repeat relevant checks and inspect the affected page.

Report measured timings as observations. Do not label a single local response time as Core Web Vitals or infer real-user performance. Use page-specific evidence to propose image, script, or rendering improvements.

The book basis is Checklist 3 on page 71. Read [current implementation notes](references/implementation-notes.md) before treating sitemap priority, FAQ markup, or llms.txt as a requirement. Use account tools for indexing evidence only within the requested scope. Submission guidance is in [submission](references/submission.md); an audit does not itself request submissions.
